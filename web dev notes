HTML boilerplate
structure of html
start off with when you create a new html file


1st thing doctype
<!DOCTYPE html> - tells browser which version of HTML it was written in 
<html lang = "en"> - root of document, actually HTML code, all going to go in the opening tag, lang = lanugage that webstie is written in
    <head> area where important information about our website are written but wont be displayed, helps website get rendered 
        <meta charset = "UTF-8"> - ensures that the chars you use get displayed correctly
        <title>My Website</title> - name shown on tab
    </head>

    <body> - inside body element is where we spend majority of our time building the website, this is where the content goes
       where 'meat' of website lies 
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        
    </body>

</html> closing tag

shortcut ! + enter
^ only works if you create a new html file 

boiler plate example: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> - makes it internet explorer compatabile
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> how the webiste will get displayed
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
    <bun>
        <cheese>
        </cheese>
        <lettuce></lettuce>
        <tomato></tomato>
